Computational Graphics

/**********************************************************************/
//How do I approach designing software?
// - As I grow in Software Development, I look at requirements of the project I'm working on and prioritize them. I make sure to use modular, clean, reusable code that is organized to keep the project well groomed. For this project, I applied Scrum tactics to keep myself organized and on track. I created a Gantt chart to pace myself and meet (personal-set) deadlines to ensure that my stress level stayed low and work was precise. This allowed me to successfully develop a 3D scene of a camera, 2 passports, and a globe with appropriate lighting, textures, color, and material.

//How do I approach developing programs?
// - When developing programs, I create a list of importance.  For this project, 3D objects, camera movement, appropriate lighting, textures, materials, and color were of highest priority. I accessed and used OpenGL libraries to load primitive objects to combine in different ways to represent more complex objects such as a globe or a camera. Essentially, I used iterative process to design each of these major sections of the project itself.
/**********************************************************************/
//How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
// - Computational Graphics has allowed me to visualize the Software Development LifeCycle in a new light. As I developed 3D objects, applied lighting and all other necessities, I could visually see my code work as the 3D objects were built correctly. It allowed me to have a deeper understanding of how objects in object-oriented programming can be used, even if they are not visual 3D objects. Because of this, I feel confident that I can apply the same principals learned in this class to future projects and my career with great success.
